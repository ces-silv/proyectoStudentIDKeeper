# 🎓 StudentIDKeeper - College ID Management System

Welcome to the **StudentIDKeeper** project! This system was developed as part of our **First Year College Project** to solve a real issue we identified during our first semester.

### 📝 The Problem
Every year, the college issues a **Student ID** to all students, but there was no efficient system in place to track whether students actually received their IDs. The process was completely paper-based, which made it difficult for both students and faculty to stay updated on the status of each ID.

### 💡 The Solution
We created a **console-based system** that allows administrators to easily manage and track the status of student IDs. With this tool, you can:

- **Store student information** (name, major, faculty, etc.)
- **Check the current status** of each student's ID
- **Filter students** by name, major, or faculty to quickly find the information you need

### 🔒 Storage Method
While this project does not use a database, it stores all data in a **file** for simplicity and ease of use. We may have skipped the database part for educational purposes, but it serves as a great starting point for learning and understanding basic data handling.

### 🎓 Educational Use
Feel free to use and modify this project for **educational purposes**. It's a simple yet effective way to learn about file management and basic data tracking.
