This was a First Year College Project. 

When we were on our first semester we noticed a problem, yearly the college give us an Student ID, but there wasn't a good process to see if they actually have your ID (the whole procces was on paper).
So we decided to create this system on the console, you can store students, and see the current status of your ID, you can even filter by name, major or faculty.

Unfortunally we do not store it in a Database but in a FILE. 

Feel free to use it with Educational Purposes.
